# breastcancer-lymphocyte cellcount-prediction


This projects highlights the use of regression techniques in predicting the cell count ( a continuous variables) in breast cancer histology whole slide image patches.  This project also stress the difference in traditional machine learning methods for image recognition and deep learning techniques using CNN's.  Canny edge detection, blob, hog, dog skimage techniques were used to extract hand crafted features.
